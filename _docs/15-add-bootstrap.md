You donâ€™t have to use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) together with React but it is a popular library for integrating Bootstrap with React apps. If you need it, you can integrate it with Create React App by following these steps:

Install React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from npm. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:

```
npm install --save react-bootstrap bootstrap@3
```

Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your `src/index.js` file:

```
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css';
// Put any other imports below so that CSS from your
// components takes precedence over default styles.
```

Import required React Bootstrap components within `src/App.js` file or your custom component files:

```
import { Navbar, Jumbotron, Button } from 'react-bootstrap';
```

Now you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method. Here is an example [App.js](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/85d8c067f6af1e56277c82d19fd4da7b/raw/6158dd991b67284e9fc8d70b9d973efe87659d72/App.js) redone using React Bootstrap.

### Using a Custom Theme

Sometimes you might need to tweak the visual styles of Bootstrap (or equivalent package). We suggest the following approach:

* Create a new package that depends on the package you wish to customize, e.g. Bootstrap.
* Add the necessary build steps to tweak the theme, and publish your package on npm.
* Install your own theme npm package as a dependency of your app.

Here is an example of adding a [customized Bootstrap](https://medium.com/@tacomanator/customizing-create-react-app-aa9ffb88165) that follows these steps.
