Create React App doesn't prescribe a specific routing solution, but [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router) is the most popular one.

Open up your terminal and run:

```
npm install --save react-router-dom
```

To try it, delete all the code in `src/App.js` and replace it with any of the examples on its website. The [Basic Example](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic) is a good place to get started.
