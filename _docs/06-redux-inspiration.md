[Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) created Redux to make development more fun with better tooling.

He's the guy who's written some amazing modules like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) and [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd).

He wanted a minimal API that improved the application structure and had better tools. Redux makes data management and debugging a whole lot easier.
